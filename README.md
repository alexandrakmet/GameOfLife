Implementation of Conway's Game Of Life

It is not a game in the conventional sense, but rather a simulation that runs on a grid of square cells, each of which can either be dead or alive.  

## Rules:
When the simulation updates, living cells interact with their neighbors according to four rules. Any living cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies due to underpopulation. Living cells with four or more neighbors die through overpopulation. Living cells with two or three live neighbors continue to survive. Dead cells with three living neighbors come to life, as if via reproduction.
